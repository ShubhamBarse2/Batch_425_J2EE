## CSS  : 
               CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
               CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
               CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
               CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.


## Why Use CSS : 

                     CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
                     CSS Saves a Lot of Work

## CSS Syntax :  
                            The CSS provides the style to the HTML element.
                            CSS style property will be applied to all the elements of the HTML. 
                            We can provide style property to the HTML element in three parts. 
+
                            1. Selector :
                                                  It is an HTML tag. All the style properties of the CSS will be applied to the selector. 
                                                  The selector tag like <h1> or <table> etc.

                             2. Property : 
                                                   It is a type of attribute that is present in HTML tags. 
                                                   All the attributes of the HTML will be converted to the CSS properties. 
                                                   The CSS properties like color, border, etc.

                              3. Value  : 
                                                 In HTML, these are assigned to the properties. 

                      Syntax:
                                   We must provide the CSS property to the HTML element in a proper way. 

                                             selector { property: value }  


## Comments in CSS   :

                                                    It is used in HTML to style the attributes without using the selectors. 

                                                    Syntax : 
                                                                                  <h1 style=" ">    </h1>

                                                      It is more time-consuming because we can only work on one page or we need to style each web page. 
                                                      In internal CSS, we style a single webpage uniquely.
